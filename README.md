# Heart-Attack-Analysis-with-EDA


. A heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction, occurs when the blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked, usually due to a blood clot. The lack of blood flow can cause damage to the heart muscle, and if not treated promptly, it can be life-threatening.

Common symptoms of a heart attack include:

Chest pain or discomfort: This can feel like pressure, tightness, or a squeezing sensation in the chest. The pain may also radiate to the arm, jaw, neck, or back.
Shortness of breath: Difficulty breathing or feeling like you can't catch your breath.
Nausea, indigestion, or vomiting: Some people may experience gastrointestinal symptoms during a heart attack.
Sweating: Cold sweats or a clammy feeling may occur.
Fatigue: Feeling unusually tired or exhausted, even with minimal physical activity.
It's important to note that symptoms can vary between individuals, and some people may not experience typical symptoms, especially women and older adults.
